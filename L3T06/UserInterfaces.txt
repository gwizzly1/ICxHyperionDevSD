1. Look at the following webpage: http://www.pnwx.com write good and bad points on the UI.

    Pros: Has all the information you need, draws your attention
    Cons: Sense overload - too many colours and flashing lights
        Too much information 
        No explanation of what company does (communication)
        No dropdown or menu 
        Very basic input controls
        Not simple in colours but too simple in everything email_address
        The colours, textures and typography is random 
        

2. Look at the following webpage: https://www.ucook.co.za and write pros and cons of UI.
    Pros:
        Immediately easy to see product
        good colours - natural 
        Use common UI features - ie basket, menu, help button 
        Easy to see where to add location 
        Very easy to use 

    Cons: The webpage doesn't fit on 1/2 screen properly - font too big so not easy to subject_line
        Maybe could have been a little more obvious about login
