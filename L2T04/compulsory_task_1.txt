2. What is a DBMS and what are it's advantages?
    DBMS stands for Database Management System. 
    This allows you to interact with databases in an easy and user friendly way.
    This is usually done so using a variety of programs to control access and manage structure.
    Advantages: 
        Better data sharing - as it can be restrictive/controlled it allows end-users more efficient access 
        Data integration - better as more end-users are able to see the data/structure clearly (not only technical roles)
        Better data consistancy - less places of truth - ie when there's a reliable and easily viewable source of information, much less likely to have multiple sources
        Improved data access - very easy to search for what you need
        Better decision making due to the easier access and speed of information movement
        Increased end-user productivity - data allows faster and better decision making
